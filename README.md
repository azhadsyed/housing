# NYC Rent Estimator App

Codebase for my NYC rent estimator app. Accepts an apartment's location, size, and amenities as inputs; outputs an estimated listing price and a SHAP-driven explanation of how that listing price is calculated.

Built in Python using Flask/Jinja, Pandas, Pymongo, Scikit-learn, and other community packages. [Click here to try!](www.howmuchrent.herokuapp.com)
